The CloudFormation templates in this repository are compiled with the intent of demonstrating my progress in cloudformation templating. 

As with all types of development, my overall intent is to be able to create more well formed, highly portable, and thus reusable, templates. All templates will mostly be written in YAML, eventually I intend to make use of the CDK which will use programming languages.
